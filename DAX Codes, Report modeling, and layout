#DAX Codes created and used in the PBI report: 

1. To avoid PBI skipping duplicates in max velocity averages, the code below creates a calculated colunmn with random digits between 0 to 0.001 added to the current max velocity.
Since we are rounding session max velocity to the tenth decimal place, the added random digits will not significantly affect the actual value. Same values can now be ranked differently
by Power BI instead of considering them ties. The code for the calculated column is below:

  no_ties = 'Sessions'[Session Max Velocity] + RAND()*0.001

2. Since the filter pane of Power BI is able to filter by TOPN, we won't have to create additional measures filtering top values of a column. However, what if I want to exclude the best
value and create an average between the second best to the nth best values, to compare with the topn averge value? This is where the measure below will come in handy. The measure below
excludes the best (Top 1) value, and average the 2nd to 4th best max velocities:


  top_vel_excluded = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Sessions'[no_ties]), 
                          FILTER(
                                  TOPN(4,'Sessions','Sessions'[no_ties]),
                                      'Sessions'[no_ties] <> MAX('Sessions'[no_ties])
       ))


Similarly, the same can be achieved with:


  top2to4 = 
  var sumtop4 = CALCULATE(SUM('Sessions'[no_ties]),TOPN(4,'Sessions','Sessions'[no_ties]))
  RETURN DIVIDE(sumtop4 - max('Sessions'[no_ties]),3)


For modeling, I create a simple star schema with one-to-many relationships between PlayerID. I opted to not add a date table since this dataset was quite small, and I only needed a simple
date "between" slicer for sessions. Athlete Name, however, was used by both sessions and historical max tables. 


In terms of layout, I will not go into too much details regarding formatting visuals and how to create reports to captivate your audience. I recommnded taking the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst
Professional Certificate courses on Coursera to get the most comprehensive knowledge on everything Power BI.
