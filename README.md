# Power-BI-Sports-Science-Report-Max-Velocity-Tracking


Please see the screenshot of the report below, which tracks how session max velocity (measured by Catapult Vector S7) trends across a given period of a player (data points have been randomized). That trend is then compared with their profile max velocity, which was set and then adjusted at certain time stamps based on session max velocity trends. All data and dashbaord formatting have been modifed for achieving anonymity.

The project is a remake report using randomized velocity data with unnamed athletes. We will be connecting a local Excel file to Power BI for this demonstration. In my acutal work setting, I was able to use the Power BI Web connector to connect to our Athlete Management System (Smartabase) directly. I will include the webpage with the web connector direction in this repository.

Overall, the repository will include:

1. This README file
2. Athlete Max Velocity Excel file
3. DAX Codes of all measures created
4. Power BI Report
5. Smartabase PBI Web connector directions


Please see an example of the end product below:
